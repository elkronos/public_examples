## analysis
Scripts primarily designed to analyze data. These scripts contain functions which allow for reproduciable analysis in an analytics workflow.

## examples
Scripts which serve as examples of how to carry out specific actions (item analysis, moderation, connecting to redcap). These scripts are educational and serve to illustrate an approach. These scripts were meant to be a on-off and do not generally contain functions designed to be embeeded into an analytics workflow.

## helpers
Scripts which allow one to analyze or visualize data. These scripts contain functions which are designed to support a wider purpose (data integration via fuzzy matching, or outlier detection). 

## visuals
Scripts designed to visualize data. Although these scripts contain functions which aggregate data, their primary purpose is to visualize data in different ways.
