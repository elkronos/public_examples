# public_examples
This repo contains publicly shared code. Please use it however you like. This code is a work in progress, and should be tested before implemented in a production environment.

## analysis
Scripts primarily designed to analyze data. These scripts contain functions which allow for reproduciable analysis in an analytics workflow. Note that the feature selection examples have all been moved over to the `feature_selection` repo (https://github.com/elkronos/feature_selection).

## examples
Scripts which serve as examples of how to carry out specific actions (item analysis, moderation, connecting to redcap). These scripts are educational and serve to illustrate an approach. These scripts were meant to be a on-off and do not generally contain functions designed to be embeeded into an analytics workflow.

## helpers
Scripts which allow one to analyze or visualize data. These scripts contain functions which are designed to support a wider purpose (data integration via fuzzy matching, or outlier detection). Note that all of the OpenAI API scripts (GPT) have been moved over to the `openai_api` repo (https://github.com/elkronos/openai_api). 

## queries
Scripts designed to query data from APIs or other systems.

## visuals
Scripts designed to visualize data. Although these scripts contain functions which aggregate data, their primary purpose is to visualize data in different ways. Note that all shiny examples have been moved over to the `shiny_examples` repo (https://github.com/elkronos/shiny_examples).
